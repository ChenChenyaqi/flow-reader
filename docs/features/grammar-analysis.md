# Grammar Analysis

FlowReader's grammar visualization helps you understand sentence structure at a glance.

## How It Works

When analyzing text, FlowReader identifies and highlights three key components:

### Subject (Blue)

The person, place, thing, or idea that the sentence is about.

### Predicate (Green)

The action or state of being in the sentence.

### Object (Orange)

The noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb.

## Visual Display

Each component is highlighted with a colored underline:

- <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #3b82f6; padding-bottom: 2px;">Subject</span> - Blue
- <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #22c55e; padding-bottom: 2px;">Predicate</span> - Green
- <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #f97316; padding-bottom: 2px;">Object</span> - Orange

## Example

**Sentence:**
