# Smart Simplification

FlowReader's smart simplification feature transforms complex English text into simple, easy-to-understand language.

## How It Works

When you select text, FlowReader uses AI to:

1. Analyze the complexity of your selected text
2. Rewrite it using simpler vocabulary (A1-A2 level)
3. Preserve the original meaning
4. Stream the result with a typewriter effect

## What Gets Simplified

- Complex sentence structures
- Advanced vocabulary
- Technical jargon
- Idiomatic expressions
- Long, convoluted sentences

## Example

**Original:**

> "The implementation of sophisticated algorithms in modern software systems necessitates a comprehensive understanding of computational paradigms."

**Simplified:**

> "Modern software uses smart computer programs. You need to understand how computers work to use them well."

## Tips

- Select 1-3 sentences at a time for best results
- Compare the original and simplified versions to learn new patterns
- Use grammar visualization alongside simplification for deeper understanding
