# Icon Placeholders

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

For development purposes, these files are referenced in manifest.json but not yet created.

To add icons later:
1. Create PNG files with a lens/magnifying glass design
2. Use a blue-purple gradient (#6366f1 to #8b5cf6)
3. Place them in the public/ directory
